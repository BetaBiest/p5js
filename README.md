# p5.js Playground

## About

 I am a student, this is my space to learn and experience p5.js.  
 Be aware that this rep probably doesn´t follow any conventions and probably contains lots of mistakes.
 However feel free to use the code I publish here for your own purposes whatever they may be.  
 If there are any question ill try to awnser them but I´m only an expert yet to become ;-).

 **Disclaimer**
 - Do not trust me
 - Do not run the code if you dont know what you doing

## Introduction

 In order for you to be able to orientate yourself in my code and to practice my .md-skills I´m giving a bit of insight how my files are structured:

 1. _index.html_ is the main site which you would want to run to see the sketch
 2. The sketches themself are placed in the folder _sketches_. If the sketch is small its just one file, else im placing it with the related files in an extra folder
 3. The sketches aren´t directly embedded in the _index.html_ but in the _sketch.html_ which is embedded in the _index.html_. So if you want to change the sketch you currently got to do this inside the _sketch.html_.

## Etc

 Have fun coding.  
 Suggetions and feedback are welcome.  
 Yes the website itself looks crappy atm. I´m working on it ;)
