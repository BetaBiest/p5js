# p5.js Playground

## About

 I am a student, this is my space to learn and experience p5.js.  
 Be aware that this rep probably doesn´t follow any conventions and probably contains lots of mistakes.
 However feel free to use the code I publish here for your own purposes whatever they may be.  
 If there are any question ill try to awnser them but I´m only an expert yet to become ;-).

 **Disclaimer**
 - Do not trust me
 - Do not run the code if you dont know what you doing

## Introduction

 In order for you to be able to orientate yourself in my code and to practice my .md-skills I´m giving a bit of insight how my files are structured:

 1. _index.html_ is the main site which you would want to run to see the sketches
 2. The sketches themself are placed in the folder _sketches_. If the sketch is small its 2 files (_\[projektname\].html_, _\[projektname\].js_), else im placing the _\[projektname\].js_ with the related _.js_ files in an extra folder
 3. The sketches aren´t directly embedded in the _index.html_ but in the _\[projektname\].html_ which is embedded in the _index.html_ over an iframe. The source from the iframe gets changed to the selected _\[projektname\].html_ by a small JS function.

## Etc
